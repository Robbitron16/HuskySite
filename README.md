# HuskySite
## Description
#### Current files being used to construct the Husky Robotics website.  Subject to change.
#### The website is not live yet, but the old website can be found here: http://students.washington.edu/dubotics/


### Notes:
#### Website I am currently constructing is stored in the directories above. Using AngularJS to manage the pages, but otherwise I wrote everything else from scratch.  Due to some styling issues with Twitter's embedded feed, the website is not live yet, but will be soon.
